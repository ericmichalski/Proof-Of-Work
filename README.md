# Proof Of Work
Produces a binary solution by iterating through every possible nonce value until a solution is found that satisfies the standard proof of work condition (hash value &lt;= target) with a given difficulty.

See [POW Report.pdf](https://github.com/ericmichalski/Proof-Of-Work/blob/main/POW%20Report.pdf) for how to run and more detailed descriptions on each of the functions and their outputs. (2022)
